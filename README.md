        <p>Weston is our robot built on mBot, equipped with a CO2 detector and ploughing power.</p>

        <!-- Detailed information on ploughing -->
        <h2>Ploughing Power</h2>
        <p>Weston is designed to perform efficient ploughing tasks. It can flatten and prepare various types of soil, making it easier to plant crops or prepare land for further agricultural processes. The ploughing feature helps in soil aeration, which improves its texture and fertility. By breaking up compacted layers of soil, Weston ensures better water absorption and root growth, leading to healthier crops.</p>

        <!-- Detailed information on CO2 detection -->
        <h2>CO2 Detection</h2>
        <p>The CO2 detector on Weston helps monitor environmental conditions by measuring the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. High CO2 levels can be an indication of poor air quality, which can affect both human health and plant growth. With Weston's CO2 detection capability, users can ensure that the environment is safe and conducive for various activities. Monitoring CO2 levels is also crucial in controlling pollution and ensuring that plants receive the optimal amount of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.</p>

        <!-- Detailed information on water sprinklers -->
        <h2>Water Sprinklers</h2>
        <p>Weston is also equipped with water sprinklers, which are essential for efficient irrigation. The sprinklers distribute water evenly across the soil, ensuring that plants receive the right amount of moisture without wasting water. This feature is particularly useful in areas where water conservation is important. With Weston's automatic sprinkling system, crops are watered consistently, promoting healthy growth while reducing the need for manual watering.</p>
